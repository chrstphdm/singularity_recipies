# SPiP, Splicing Pipeline Prediction

SPiP is a decisional tree running a cascade of bioinformatics tools. Briefly, SPiP uses SPiCE tool for the consensus splice sites (donor and acceptor sites), MES for polypyrimidine tract between -13 and -20, BPP for branch point area between -18 and -44, an homemade score to research cryptic/de novo activation and Î”tESRseq for exonic splicing regulatory element until to 120 nt in exon
