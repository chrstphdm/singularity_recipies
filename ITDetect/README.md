# ITDetect

ITDetect (Internal Tandem Duplication Detector) is a sensitive ITD variant caller for next-generation sequencing data. It detects candidate ITD position from soft-clipped reads and determines if actual ITD may exist based on the reads whose alignment pattern supports presumed ITD. Its performance was validated using whole exome sequencing data of AML patient samples with FLT3-ITD.
