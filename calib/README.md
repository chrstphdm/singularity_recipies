# Calib clusters barcode tagged paired-end reads based on their barcode and sequence similarity

Calib clusters paired-end reads using their barcodes and sequences. Calib is suitable for amplicon sequencing where a molecule is tagged, then PCR amplified with high depth, also known as Unique Molecule Identifier (UMI) sequencing.
